1059 Prime Factors （25 分）

Given any positive integer *N*, you are supposed to find all of its prime factors, and write them in the format *N* = *p*1*k*1×*p*2*k*2×⋯×*p**m**k**m*.

### Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer *N* in the range of **long int**.

### Output Specification:

Factor *N* in the format *N* `=` *p*1`^`*k*1`*`*p*2`^`*k*2`*`…`*`*p**m*`^`*k**m*, where *p**i*'s are prime factors of *N* in increasing order, and the exponent *k**i* is the number of *p**i* -- hence when there is only one *p**i*, *k**i* is 1 and must **NOT** be printed out.

### Sample Input:

```in
97532468
```

### Sample Output:

```out
97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291
```







### **ac_code**
